# LIRI Node App

Please view my LIRI tutorial video here: [LIRI Node App Demo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yojqRfaxroPG6-6pIbv2kmO2JCkWC9_d)

You can search your favorite songs, concerts, and movies using the LIRI Node App!

Using terminal, navigate to the repository. From here, use the following commands to get real time information!

* `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>`

* `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

* `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>`

* `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
    * This command will run the contents of the `random.txt` file. You can edit the parameters in this file (while keeping the same format) and LIRI will run whatever it finds in there!

All your commands and the data received will also be logged in the `log.txt` file.

**How to use:**
* Clone the repo to your local machine
* In Terminal, cd into the directory
* Run `npm install` to download the developer dependencies
* Run the above commands!

Have fun!

**APIs used:**
* Spotify
* Bands in Town
* OMDB
